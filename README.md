# PS6
# The dataset I used focuses on the most popular artists of recent history and statistics on their success. 
# My main goal with this dataset was to explore which countries and genres had the most popular artists. 
# My plot displays individual artists with their sales, and the widget filters the plot to only artists from a given country. The color widgets change the color of the graph only. 
# The table displays artist name, country, years active, genre, and sales. The widget is a slider that lets you select only the top (x) artists from the data. I thought this was fun to look at since most music charts operate on a top rankings system. 
# I spent probably 8 hours total on this.
